# offsec-saturdays


Weekly offensive security + vulnerability research practice, done every Saturday.
This repo documents repeatable workflows, writeups, proof-of-concepts (safe + minimal),
and mitigation guidance.

## Rules of Engagement
I only test:
- Systems I own
- Explicitly authorized targets
- Public CTF/labs (e.g., PortSwigger, HTB, THM)
- Open-source software in a local test environment

No real-world unauthorized testing. No sensitive data. No unpatched 0-days published.
